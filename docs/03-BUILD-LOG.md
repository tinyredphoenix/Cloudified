# Cloudified shared handbook 3 — build log and handoff state

Updated 2026-10-07. Keep this file factual and append-focused. Proposed work,
compiled code and physical service/device evidence are different states.
No credentials, private media, raw secret-bearing responses or personal logs here.

## Current handoff state

- Active editing batch: none. Builder may claim P1; architect reserves P2 core.
- P0: architecture/repository/infrastructure complete; latest handbook checks
  recorded below before commit.
- P1: ready for Builder; no app project or screens exist yet.
- P2: assigned to Architect, planned; no core implementation/tests exist yet.
- P3–P6: implementation handoffs, no intermediate app-test gates.
- P7: first full integrated build/test; P8: debugging iterations/release.
- No demo/mock/seeded data or simulated uploads are permitted.
- Main project location: existing Mac checkout. USB drive untouched.
- Full local Xcode: absent; Swift command-line compiler available.
- GitHub: private `tinyredphoenix/Cloudified`, origin configured, main synced at
  the start of this handbook batch. `v0.0.1-plan` is a planning tag.
- Cloud builds/device integration: no app build or device upload demonstrated.

## Verified earlier milestones

| Commit/tag | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `80abd82`, `v0.0.1-plan` | Architecture/specs, resource policy, manual workflow and packaging scaffold; no app target |
| `0090164` | Recorded temporary GitHub server creation errors |
| `2154262` | Private remote created; main and annotated planning tag verified remotely; setup blocker resolved |

Earlier checks passed: local Markdown targets, shell syntax, workflow YAML parsing
and the missing-project guard. GitHub setup did not dispatch a cloud build.

## 2026-10-07 — P0 handoff/dashboard refinement

Owner: Architect. Purpose: provide four entry-point handbooks, exact module/file
ownership, executable P1 assignment, architect-owned critical P2, and overall
dashboard/concurrent-upload acceptance requirements.

Changed scope: four handbooks; README/AGENTS/CONTRIBUTING entry points; dashboard
status contract. No app implementation, signing, SDK download or disk changes.

Environment evidence: `swift --version` reports Apple Swift 6.4 on this Mac.
This is tool availability, not an app/core compile result.

Checks completed:

- `python3 scripts/check_docs.py`: passed, 14 Markdown files/local targets checked.
- `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check`: passed, including the new
  handbooks in the staged check.
- Focused `rg` consistency check: Dashboard naming, P1/P2 ownership, concurrent
  lanes and remaining/total wording align across handbooks and existing contracts.

Milestone scope: handoff documentation only, no app/core implementation evidence.
Open limitations: real Xcode project, core, adapters and device verification remain
unimplemented. Both-lane concurrency is a required test, not yet a demonstrated
feature. Current phase authorization is P1 only for Builder; P2 author is Architect.

## 2026-10-07 — user testing/logging revision

Owner: Architect. User requires no demo/mock/seeded app data, the first app test
only after every feature is built/integrated, then debugging iterations. Previous
per-phase test gates are superseded; static review and necessary compiler checks
remain implementation activities. No app/test/build was executed by this revision.

Updated handbooks and linked contracts remove the demo-model assignment and
intermediate testing/build requirements. P2 now includes structured persistent
diagnostics; P3–P6 must instrument their real paths. P7 is first complete-app
build/test and P8 debugging/release. Removed sample dashboard numbers to prevent
accidental app seed data. Failures/receipts remain separate from rotating logs.

Documentation validation: `python3 scripts/check_docs.py` passed for 14 Markdown
files; `git diff --check` passed. A focused text scan found and removed the old
demo-model assignment, controlled-adapter gate and feasibility-test phase order.
No functional app tests or cloud builds were run.
Implementation status remains unchanged: app/core/provider code is not built yet.

## Batch log template

Copy this below when claiming/completing an assigned batch:

```text
Batch / owner / status:
Purpose:
Reserved paths / active writer:
Changed files:
Dependency revisions / artifact provenance:
Checks (exact command, outcome, evidence location):
Cloud run URL / artifact checksum, if applicable:
Physical-device evidence, if applicable:
Failures / known limitations:
Decision changes (reference handbook 4 IDs):
Commit / milestone tag, after it exists:
Next handoff / release of reserved paths:
```

Do not fill successful results in advance. If a check cannot run, record why and
what remains unverified. A generated IPA without SideStore/device verification
is a build artifact, not an accepted release.
